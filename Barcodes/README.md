DNA barcodes for demultiplexing the raw sequencing data of the GUIDE-seq expriments developed in the CHANGE-seq study.


An updated version of the GUIDE-seq pipeline available at https://github.com/tsailabSJ/guideseq.

The raw data is avliable from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA625995.
