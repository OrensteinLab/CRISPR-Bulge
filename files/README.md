# Datasets
You must unzip the dataset folder.

Since the zipped file was uploaded using Git LFS, you need to clone the Repository using Git LFS.

- FullGUIDEseq dataset is just GUIDEseq and NewGUIDEseq datasets combined

# Trained models
trained models that were used in comparing CRISPR-Net and CRISPR-IP on the TrueOT dataset.

Models naming here and in the manuscript are different:
```
c_1 = MLP-Embd
c_2 = GRU-Embd
c_3 = GRU
```
