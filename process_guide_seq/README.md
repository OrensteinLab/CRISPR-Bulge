This folder contains:

1. The DNA barcodes for demultiplexing the raw sequencing data of the GUIDE-seq experiments (`barcodes_for_raw_data_process_pipeline`). More information is in the README file in the folder.

2. The processed files from the GUIDE-seq pipeline and code for realigning the OTS using our SWOffinder tool (`process_identified_files`). More information is in the README file in the folder.

The inactive OTS is generated using SWOffinder and added here as a submodule. To run SWoffinder, see the README file in the submoudle.
