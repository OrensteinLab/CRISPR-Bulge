DNA barcodes for demultiplexing the raw sequencing data of the GUIDE-seq expriments developed in:

1. The CHANGE-seq study (`CR_Lazzarotto_2020`). The raw data is avliable from NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA625995. You may contact us or the CHANGE-seq developers for more information.
2. Tsai 2015 (`Tsai_2015`). The raw data is avliable at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/gvy81adejkdjett90bkmo/h?rlkey=2fs273wgpgxqjk6t57qqenjzo&dl=0. In case files are not avliable anymore, please contact us or the developrs of this dataset.
3. Chen 2017 (`Chen_2017`). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP116962.
4. Listgarten 2018 (`Listgarten_2018`). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP117146.

The folders contain the `.yaml` files that were used in the GUIDE-seq pipeline.

An updated and parallelized version of the GUIDE-seq pipeline available at https://github.com/ofiryaish/guideseq_parallelized.
